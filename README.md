# Assedju
A project tailored as a beginner's guide into the world of web development implementing both server-side and client-side design.  This project features the use of Node.js (with several npm modules - including Socket.IO for the use of WebSockets) and an external MySQL database for the back-end.  The standard web technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) were mainly used for you to see what you see ... as well as a templating engines (Pug - formerly, Jade).
